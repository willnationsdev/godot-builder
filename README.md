# godot-builder

A set of Godot Editor GUI tools to simplify the process of building NativeScript libraries.

**Note: This is a Work-in-progress and is NOT YET READY for use.** Current items on the to-do list include...

- Finish refactoring the GUI and config content into EditorInspectorPlugin code.
	- This will remove most of the code and complex logic, greatly simplifying the project.
	- It will also make it much easier to modify the project to support additional content.
- Finish implementation of Godot-Next's FileSystemItemList script so that I can copy/paste that code into this project.
	- This will allow me to display lists of include directories or library files to include via the Inspector (no need for custom GUI content).
- Finish implementing the final "build" and "clean" operations for the execute script.
